# EXPL.ONE

> Open source, community-driven Web3 ecosystem building ONE perfect tool per category.

## Overview

EXPL.ONE is the main landing page for the ONE ecosystem - a collection of Web3 tools built with purpose, owned by the community, and powered by EXPL Nodes. We believe in quality over quantity: ONE perfect tool per category instead of thousands of mediocre options.

## Core Philosophy

- **ONE Perfect Tool Per Category**: Escaping digital chaos with focused, quality solutions
- **Open Source**: Every line of code is public on GitHub
- **Community-Driven**: No profit-hungry tech giants, built by people who love what they create
- **Fair Revenue Model**: 45% to EXPL Node owners, 45% to ONE Creators, 10% to founders

## EXPL Nodes

The backbone of the ecosystem. Each EXPL Node:
- Grants shareholder status across ALL ecosystem projects
- Earns 171 EXPL tokens daily for 731 days (125,000 EXPL total)
- Receives share of 45% of ALL revenue distributed to Node owners
- Total supply: 1 million Nodes across 3 batches (12k, 88k, 900k)
